## Project Title:
#create intractive circuit for 3 leds with 3 buttons

## Description:
This project is part of the Electronics Track in the Smart Methods training program. The goal was to design and implement a simple interactive circuit using 3 push buttons and 3 LEDs connected to an Arduino UNO. Each button is linked to a specific LED, so pressing a button activates its corresponding LED.

This project demonstrates basic digital input/output (I/O) operations using Arduino and highlights how user interaction can control outputs via simple code logic.

## Objective:
1.**Understand digital inputs and outputs.**
2.**Practice circuit wiring using a breadboard.**
3.**Apply Arduino programming to control LED behavior through button presses.**
4.**Strengthen foundational skills in electronics and microcontroller-based systems.**

## Components Used:
1.**Arduino UNO**

2.**3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)**

3.**3 Push Buttons**

4.**3 × 220Ω resistors (for LEDs)**

5.**3 × 10kΩ resistors (for buttons - pull-down)**

6.**Breadboard**

7.**Jumper wires**

## How It Works:
1.**Each button is connected to a digital input pin on the Arduino.**

2.**When a button is pressed, the Arduino detects the HIGH signal and activates the output pin connected to the corresponding LED.**

3.**Pull-down resistors are used to ensure stable input signals when buttons are not pressed.**
